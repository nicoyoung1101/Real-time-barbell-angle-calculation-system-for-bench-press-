This study proposes a method for analyzing benchpress movements in powerlifting. By utilizing DeepLabCut, the motion of the barbell is tracked and analyzed from a frontal
perspective, enabling a quantitative evaluation of form accuracy.Specifically, the position and tilt angle of the barbell are estimated and visualized based on video data. In the experimental phase,
differences in movement were assessed based on body composition and gender. The proposed method for analyzing bench pressmovements in powerlifting demonstrates its potential to provide
