<h2 align="center">Bench Press Motion Analysis (Powerlifting)</h2>
This study proposes a method for analyzing bench press movements in powerlifting using DeepLabCut. From a frontal video, the barbell’s path (trajectory) and tilt angle are automatically tracked and visualized, enabling quantitative evaluation of form accuracy. In the experimental phase, movement differences were assessed across groups stratified by body composition and gender. The results demonstrate the method’s potential to support objective technique assessment and training feedback.
